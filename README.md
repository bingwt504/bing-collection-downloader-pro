# Bing Image Creator Collection Downloader pro (Chrome Extension wannabe)
Based on a pre-existing Chrome Extension by rugia813:
(https://github.com/rugia813/bing-collection-downloader/tree/master)
Original version features:
 - adds a button to the collection page which downloads all images you saved as a single zip file.
 - if the image is deleted, will try to download the thumbnail version instead.

This version (in addition):
 - downloads the prompts as .txt files with the same number as the image file.

# How to use
1) Download the files of this repository in a folder in your PC.
2) Open Google Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
3) At the top right, turn on Developer mode.
4) Click Load unpacked.
5) Select the folder where you downloaded the files.
6) Go to your Bing Collections Page, you should find a big "Download All Images" button on the left, and a small button next to any custom collection.

# UPDATE 24/05/2025:
please be aware that the HTML file is NOT PORTABLE!! Then it will break if you move it to another folder. So I'd suggest you to KEEP THE ORIGINAL ZIP FILES, since they will always work.
